// ### larger.js
// Write a program that reads two Number variables and prints which one is greater. (e.g. "The larger number of 7 and 3 is 7")

// **Requirements**
// * Your program should maintain two variables
// * It should correctly identify which is larger and print that result
let numOne = 20
let numTwo = 30
if (numOne > numTwo){
    console.log(numOne + ' is larger than ' + numTwo)
 } else{
            console.log(numTwo + ' is larger than ' + numOne)
        }
