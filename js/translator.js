// Write a program that reads a variable with language code and prints the translation of "Hello World" for that language.

// Requirements

// You should have a variable for the language code (e.g. "es", "de", "fr", "en").
// Your program should print the translation of "Hello World" based on the language code in the variable.
// It should support at least 3 languages
// Make sure to test with the different languages you choose.
// (Feel free to Google the translation if you aren't fluent.)

const language = {
  french: "Bonjour le monde",

  english: "Hello world",

  Spanish: "Hola Mundo",
};

console.log(language.french);
console.log(language.Spanish);
console.log(language.english);
